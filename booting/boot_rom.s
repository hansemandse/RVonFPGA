# Purpose      : This file is a part of a full system implemented as part
#              : of a bachelor's thesis at DTU. The thesis is written in
#              : cooperation with the Institute of Mathematics and
#              : Computer Science.
#              : This piece of code represents a minimal bootloader used
#              : on the RISC-V processor. It initializes the system after
#              : a reset and provides basic IO and program loading-related
#              : functionality.
